# release of a version has a build number other than 1. And so far, the
# release URLs have not followed a consistent pattern for whether and how

# This URL pattern has worked for most releases. If a version has multiple
# builds, set the `source url:` again explicitly to the one appropriate for

# The git portable archives come with their own copy of posix related tools
# i.e. msys/basic posix/what-do-you-mean-you-dont-have-bash tools that git
# needs.  Surprising nobody who has ever dealt with this on windows, we ship
# our own set of posix libraries and ported tools - the highlights being
# tar.exe, sh.exe, bash.exe, perl.exe etc.  Since our tools reside in
# embedded/bin, we cannot simply extract git's bin/ cmd/ and lib directories
# into embedded.  So we we land them in embedded/git instead.  Git uses a
# strategy similar to ours when it comes to "appbundling" its binaries.  It has
# a /bin top level directory and a /cmd directory.  The unixy parts of it use
# /bin.  The windowsy parts of it use /cmd.  If you add /cmd to the path, there
# are tiny shim-executables in there that forward your call to the appropriate
# internal binaries with the path and environment reconfigured correctly.
# Unfortunately, they work based on relative directories...  so /cmd/git.exe
# looks for ../bin/git.  If we want delivery-cli or other applications to access
# git binaries without having to add yet another directory to the system path,
# we need to add our own shims (or shim-shims as I like to call them).  These
# are .bat files in embedded/bin - one for each binary in git's /cmd directory -
# that simply call out to git's shim binaries.
