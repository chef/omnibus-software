# wide-character support:
# Ruby 1.9 optimistically builds against libncursesw for UTF-8
# support. In order to prevent Ruby from linking against a
# package-installed version of ncursesw, we build wide-character
# support into ncurses with the "--enable-widec" configure parameter.
# To support other applications and libraries that still try to link
# against libncurses, we also have to create non-wide libraries.
#
# The methods below are adapted from:
# http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/development/chapter06/ncurses.html
