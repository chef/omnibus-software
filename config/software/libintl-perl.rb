# ## libintl-perl
# libintl-perl is a localization library. Normally it would be installed
# automatically by `cpanm` when you install whatever application you want, and
# you wouldn't need an explict software definition for it. Unfortunately,
# libintl-perl changed the license from LGPLv2 to GPLv3 in version 1.24, making
# it unusable in products that cannot ship GPLv3 code. By pre-installing
# version 1.23 or earlier, it's possible to workaround the licensing change for
# now.
