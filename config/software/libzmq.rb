    # We eventually narrowed this down to the `atomic_counter.hpp`. This class has a bunch of overrides to support atomic
    # operations using system or compiler native features. As a fallback it would use a mutex to perform atomic operations but
    # we were seeing that mutex never be initialized. So we added support for the built-in AIX atomic operations fetch_and_add.
