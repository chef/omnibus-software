#XXX: this depends on ruby-windows-devkit, but the caller MUST specify that dep, or else the slightly goofy
# library build_order optimizer in omnibus will promote ruby-windows-devkit to being before direct deps of
# the project file which will defeat our current strategy of installing devkit absolutely dead last.
