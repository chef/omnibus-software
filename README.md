## Using Your Own Software Definitions

This repository is the collection of Chef Software's software definitions. We like that others get utility out of them, but they are not meant to be comprehensive collection of all software on the planet. For more information, please read [Omnibus, a look forward](https://blog.chef.io/omnibus-a-look-forward) on the Chef blog.

For more information on writing your own software definitions, please see [the Omnibus README](https://github.com/chef/omnibus#sharing-software-definitions).
